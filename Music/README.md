There are two folders: Genius and GeniusCopy. Genius is a music recommender system that uses cosine similarity to give the top 10 billboard hip hop songs similar to the input. The entire web app/model is dockerized.

GeniusCopy is an attempt to use docker-compose and volumes to exchange data. While it is more complex, it was built as a learning exercise to learn more about docker-compose.
