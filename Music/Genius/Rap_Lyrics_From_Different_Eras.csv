Yeah


Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from…


In New York (ayy, aha) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (aha, aha, aha) (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (new)
Big lights will inspire you (come on) (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You're welcome, OG) (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh) (I made you hot, nigga)


Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's…


In New York (ayy) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
(Welcome to the bright light, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)


Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip , now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien


In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)


One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, ""Yeah"" (come on)
(Come on) Yeah (come on)


In New York (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

“We're going to skate to one song, one song only”
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me


So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock
Rollies that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose
I’m moving the Nets to BK


Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray


She said, ""'Ye, can we get married at the mall?""
I said, ""Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all""
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
(Ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(Ball so hard) ""Your whip so cold"" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I’m in France, ahah, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
‘Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga?
What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer?
What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
‘Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh


“I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going”


Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
Ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me


You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin’ like the summer ain’t mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
(You know how many hot bitches I own?)
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone

You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)


And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail


Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh


And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
And we all just entertainers


And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you

Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water


You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller


And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much, yeah

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock


Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave


I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag


Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock


(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos


I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her


Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)


She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment


She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!


Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby

It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

Young Money


I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over


Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it


I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over


One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh


I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights

And you don't do it for the man, men never notice

Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know


I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know


They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise

""Money on my mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…


I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel better

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise


I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton


I know things get hard, but girl, you got it

You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone

Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S-s-s' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
""Konvict"" just like Akon
'Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on

And for your loving, I'mma die hard like Bruce Willis

I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn’t mean you’re alive
Don’t worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it’s my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire (Pyre!)
In this very moment, I’m king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No, I’m not lucky, I’m blessed,Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn’t do it all alone, We!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it’s crazy
'Cause I’m still hood, Hollywood couldn’t change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn’t faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we're done
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know
This night, just reminds me of
Everything that they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up!
It’s a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of


I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive


Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
What I tell ‘em hoes bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia, that’s word to Lil' Cease
I’m in The Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout-out to the CEO 500 degrees
Shout-out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year, we ain’t get the memo
Young King, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed, he ain’t even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain’t even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can’t believe we really made it, I’m partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I’m really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives!


I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive


This is my moment, I waited all my life, I can just tell it's time
Drifting away, I’m one with the sunsets, I have become alive


I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson


Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July

Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only


Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though!
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that errbody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh! That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it

That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it; ""Wait! Where you going?""
""I'm leaving you”, ""No, you ain't, come back!""
We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit , it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me when it comes to love
You're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire, I'm just gonna


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

I love the way you lie

Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot


But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece


'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got


Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—


I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard


So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you!
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)


Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MC's, blood gets spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through
A struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Kane is in the building


Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go


Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first


Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me


Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first


How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat


Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain


Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders


I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain


I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up


I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain


Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm, dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes, on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain


Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses


I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain


More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'

I got a story to tell
You know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved


I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it


I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get 'em,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch,"" I say, ""Get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin'""
She say, ""What's missin'?"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed""
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh


I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share


I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (uh)


Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself


She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music


Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing


When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down, bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100


Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night

Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, 'cause every nigga that I’m with Taylor'd

Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass


I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do


I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…


I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass


I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do


Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…


Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass


I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do


I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…


Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it


All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""Fuck it, I’m on one""


I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya ""everything is great""
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence

Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response

That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby

I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not

Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures


Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya

She think I’m the realest out and I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us""
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord


Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya

Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go


I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined


I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go


I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go


Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic


I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up the the ceiling

Yeah! Let's go!
Alright, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country


Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us


Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…


Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance

And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

Title: Fancy
(bobbie gentry)
I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of new orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood
She said here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""to thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The tow of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen fancy
And they'll be nice to you
She said here's your chance fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown
Well, that was the last time I saw my ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my mama's been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That i's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But fancy was my name
Here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
It wasn't very long after a benevolent man
Took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a georgia mansion
In an elegant new york townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hippocrits
That would call me bad
And criticize mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear
She said, here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your mama's gonna help you uptown
I guess she did

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby


This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing


You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)


I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show ya (show 'em what, show 'em what) what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (it's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby


I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh


You used to be thirsty for me (right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)


I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show ya (show 'em what, show 'em what) what's really crazy

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul


And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time (Yeah)


Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go ape shit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny?

Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate

Annat annat annat

Nått för längesen läng-lä-längesen

Om jag är fri eller bunden

Jag byter former bara för att passa in här

Och ingen vet hur men när allt går åt helvete

Det finns hål jag försökte fylla med
Pengar pengar pengar

Tills dom är helt borta borta borta

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey


Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (goddamn)
Yeh, I know your baby mama fond of me (goddamn)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli (goddamn)
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me (goddamn)
Tell her I can get that pussy easily (goddamn)
Tell her I can hit that shit so greasily (goddamn)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (damn)

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna, hey I'm beyond, ayy, ayy
Said I'm beyond all that fuck shit, ayy


I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami


In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli
(my weed, my weed)
Yeah, I know your baby mama fond of me (she fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli

Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me

Said that I can get that pussy easily

Said I can hit that shit so greasily (oh yeah, oh yeah)

Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table

Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo

I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s

Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah…
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for


I ain't been gettin' high
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frowned since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note


I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind


Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...


She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother, I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber


I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye

It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said, ""I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to""


Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves


Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill


Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves


If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott


Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""

Once you get em crunk they start, they won't stop
Hoes get naked for cheese, they love that
Take tha baddest bitch in tha club, I fucked that
Some these bitches been crunk since first day
Some of these bitches in tha club, they don't play
Half these bitches who shake it, they turn gay
Niggas gone pay to see pussy, anyway (ahh, ahh)

(Kaine:)
Some of these niggas be walkin' tha thin line
Fuckin' wit' these hoes wit' no clothes and no mind
Baby girl out to get money she gone shine
Everyday of work she gone be there on time
Her pussy poppin' shouty be sweatin' like she noid
Kinda like tha way that thang beat like a heart
Turn around yeah that's it, good lord
Tryin' to do a Chinese split and make it fart

(""Ying yang in this thang"" in the background at
The beginning of each line)
Ying Yang in this thang, from the A-T-eeL
Whistle while you twurk if you really real
In tha club smelling like some wood
In my neighbourhood
Girls get crunk in the piz ball
If you sit down, get up off tha wall
Males only speak, if the females flirt
If you get crunk, whistle while you twurk

(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones


I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em


Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops


Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at


Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""


I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""


O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem


Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons


(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones


I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem


Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all


Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)


Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)

Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

However you want it is
How I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyent is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop fronting ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machette, pockets heavy
Slang more cane than Eddie; I represent uno tres nueve

Bust off like a tre-eight then vacate

C'mon, c'mon
Now, get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
What's with the melodrama?
Fella's wanna hover in my cypher like a helicopter
Like it's a special honor, the stealth bomba, gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla, intercontinental
Takin' you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original, cavemen quest for my fire
Express my desire to drop this new shit
These record executives keep tellin' me y'all stupid
Now if they right, shut the fuck up
Revolutionaries, throw your guns up
Whether you a Bourgeois broad who actin' stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin' the club up
We gonna make y'all feel this, break y'all spirit
If y'all fake that realness, word, we bringin' it
Ringin' it in from the new millennium to way after that
I call these cats Reynolds 'cuz they plastic wrap
Kill all the yappin', let's make it happen
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say, â€œActionâ€, you start fakin'
I start breakin'
The whole joint start shakin'
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
To be continued
Let's see what's next up on the menu, run up in you
Lyrics that be fuckin' with you
In the mental, pick any mental, instru, funda, detri
Extra, extra large like the borough of Brooklyn
The residential, existentialist, specialist
Like Sly Stone wit my poem an' fly song
Ride along with cats who live great an' die strong, word
We gonna rock till nothin' else matters
Y'all catch bodies, we catch excellent cadavers
Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth an' we peppermint altoids
Step in the high, reppin' the spot called Flatbush
Whether rappers or actors, you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity
Kill all the yappin', let's make it happen
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say, â€œActionâ€, you start fakin'
I start breakin'
The whole joint start shakin'
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Word, Flatbush, Brownsville
 niggas, move somethin'
CHI and West Side niggas, move somethin'
Cincinatti in the house, you got to move somethin'
My niggas in the dirty South got to move somethin'
The South Bronx, 125, nigga, move somethin'
 make it live, nigga, move somethin'
Miami all the way to Philly got to move somethin'

Get yo' main ho sprung
Chokin' on my blowgun
She swallowed all my bubble gum
Said it was so yum yum
All off in her tum tum
Playboy you stay dumb dumb
Now what? Uh huh
Last night, I was in them guts
Uh huh
A young playa cut yo' what?
Uh huh
She was tryin' to get a nut
Uh huh
And we gon' meet back at the hut
Uh huh
Come on




A-town, late nights
I'm off in 112, posted up as usual downstairs
With a couple of clydesdales
Sippin zinfandel
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up
And cheat again, caked up
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend
Come on




She said I love my man, man man man
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wandered in
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After day you met her, better tell her, 'fore another feller
Pet her kitten, sittin' sittin', chittin' chittin', spittin' spittin', hittin' hittin'

It's like Vietnam on the ghetto in these streets
You die how you live, the strong eat the weak
Red and blue rags for the souljas that be bangin
And warriors on the wall for the souljas left hangin

And the souljas up in heaven, may you all rest in peace (Ya heard me?)

Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation


I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And I knew you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year two to the G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama


I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You driving me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

Yo, man

Open up, man
Yeah, what do you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how all of this happened
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright...


Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me


How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”


But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?


Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers tryin to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said


What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life


Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills


Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit
Ah shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
(Gunshots) I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (""me!"")
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! (""oh."")
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch before she crashes out


Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
(Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?)
It got to be acid 'cause the X is gone
(Yeah, I took 'em all, dog, with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone) No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he about to swallow his tongue
(Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?)
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
(Yeah, I think I did too much)
(This substance equals cuffs)
(Red pills, blue pills, and green)

Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some-, some-, some-
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'


Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for dope to smoke? No? Okey-doke
I'm packin' my nose with coke
 Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I got to strangle an infant (You're crazy!)


I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any shrooms?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs, because our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too
(Swift, chill!) – I just want to get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-heady guy
Heroin mescaline pencil leads, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah, right) – bitch, I'm for real
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty slut!

North Carolina! Come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us, yes sir!


You remember them days y'all, we used to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song y'all
We used to (Rep our city, rep our city!)
Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
(hah!) My house, my home, my hood (hah!)
My brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)
My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been being
Y'all niggas just getting it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta something
We were bullshhh! (ahh!)


This one's for North Carolina! Come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter

Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina! Come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh
This one's for who? Us, us, us, yes sir!


Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask something stupid
(What you think you doin'?) What it look like?
Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?
(Beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb)
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, ""I told ya!""


This one's for North Carolina! Come on and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina! Come on and raise up
This one's for you? Uh-uh

Ohhhh Kay (Get down now)

Yea, ok
Now I'm in the spot where I wanna be
Money spent, niggas gettin bent, chicks in front of me
Just the way I like it, hunnies turnin somethin
I got a seat up in the cut and I'm burnin somethin
Booties dancin 'round a nigga and I'm killin one
Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table
I'm fuckin with this chick with a fat batty and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin on ya Henny, askin where the weed at
Lemme put you onto somethin
You fuckin with a big nigga, no frontin


Uh shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin
Fuckin with me for real, it's gone be somethin
Yea, I'm talkin lights, camera, action
Had me singin ""I'm sorry Ms. Jackson""


I love the way it's goin down she got the thong on
She started bouncin more once she heard the ""Thong Song""
Them high heels got them calves lookin right too
Shorty come live with me for the night true
Shit I'm only tryin to holla - it's only right you holla back
So where you headed lemme follow that
Now word up I got plans for you
It's more than my tongue and my hands'll do
The way you move to the music - it make a nigga wanna
Take you up outta here, go somewhere, loose it
And your physique is off the chain
It's gonna be hard gettin you off the brain
I mean we could take a drive in the X5
The way you boogie on the floor, know that sex slide
You's a dime piece, I'm tryin to see somethin
Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin




I got a few hours left 'til a nigga jet
And I'm hopin that it's you that a nigga get
Hear them callin out ya name, I geuss ya showtime
Get'cha money shorty, lemme see you pole climb
Toes out, back showin off the tat-toooo
Fuck the dumb shit, a nigga had to snatch youuuu
Lookin as good as ya smell, pay your own bills
Ask officer, cuz your pushin your own wheels
Yea I'm feelin you tryin to see the deal with you
What's goin on, later on, can I chill with you?
We can do anything that you wanna do
You know the way a nigga feel, all I want is you
Get ya dance on
Love the way you make the moves with no pants on
Let's ride!
Bounce to ya man's song
Let's get to goin, it's goin on before the chance gone
Next stop




Yo, turn with me now
Do my thing, hey swing with me now
Bink dawg now, one shot deal shit
Keep it tight, and this is how we steal shit
It's that real shit, it's that new shit
How we come thru shit

And cross the culture on the generation age gap, never can you fade that
We make your body like, rock to this
Everybody's block parties gonna walk to this
To the family, here's a number one
And all those haters who ain't thinking we still having fun
Better throw your towel in son

How many people we inspired to pursue this?
Well if you wanna test the man to the truth is
Naughty by Nature makes that Feel Good music

I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe


Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that


Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?


Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada

She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, ‘cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country
Think she like me ‘cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some bread

How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoaa


You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh huh)

And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah


Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble, man, every bottle is gone

I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop

Keep the dancefloor packed that’s without a doubt

Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off (car noise)
Looking bottom off my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)

Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, 'Lil Howard you weak'
But you know how that go, what I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess with it? Please don't!
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong on, said I looked at her and said


Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)


Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry be happy and smile


Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy

Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen

Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her

Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan
Cause after that, then I take it to the dome
Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well)

Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' Tags
From Champions to Slow Jammin', oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on


Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight


Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming ""my, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight


Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?

You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath
You got such a sensational ass
I'mma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

Tell you you're the queen that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees in stores

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me


One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none


Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.

Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get on me

They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong

Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know

And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya


I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh


Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could


Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me


(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?


Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me


From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game


Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think: What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma


Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection cause I'll be your protection

He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?


On and on and on and on
And on and... and on and on and on

Lean wit it, rock wit it!


I bounce in the club so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm looking for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee
I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank
Oh I think they like that
Before I leave the house I'm slizzard on the goose
And I'm higher than a plane so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it (lean wit it)
And I can rock wit it (rock wit it)
And if you gotta friend
She gotta suck a cock wit it!


Ay gon and rock wit it (gon rock wit it)
Gon and lean wit it (gon lean wit it)
Rock so damn hard, you break your spleen wit it (you break your spleen wit it)
Pull up ya jeans wit it (pull up ya jeans wit it)
Smoke some green wit it (smoke some green wit it)
And the spot ain't crunk bitch if we ain't in it
If you don't wanna do it, then I'll make you dance
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands
When you see me hit the spot, betta watch that boy
Charlay, from the road wit Dem Franchize Boyz


Lean wit it, rock wit it!


I'm too clean to wanna pop lock
From left to right a nigga lean
Vibing to the beat, check my feet
You ain't got these
I rock then bend my knees
Everytime the beat drop
Lean wit it Rock wit me
Freeze befo' your fingers pop
Purple leen purple green grams in my sock
What the fuck you mean
You ain't seen buddy on the block
They call me Doctor Doc
I prescribe what a nigga need
Make 'em lean and rock
Old school people pat cha feet


Shit I'm pimpin in the club
Til the hoes start to act up
Cuz they see my chain
And a nigga throwing them stacks up
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo'
They screaming 'Nigga do your dance'!
You can roll yo arms (roll yo arms)
And just put 'em in rotation (rotation)
Go side to side
And snap yo fingers like temptations
Dog I'm all out of state
Doin a dance they never seen that
I ain't Fat Joe
But snap your fingers then you lean back


Lean wit it, rock wit it!


Rock left then snap your fingers, rock right then snap your fingers
Ay what's happenin', lean wit me, rock wit me
Gotta pill pop wit me, go on take a shot wit me
Call me Teddy, I got grams don't hate, nigga shop wit me
D.F.B So So Def, hell yeah we known bitch

Rock left Rock right, You can get that (Shit)
Lean back like Fat Joe and snap your wrist back


Gangsters don't dance (Naw) They lean wit it rock wit it
Glock wit me Pop quickly
Gangsters gon rock wit it

Get nasty flashy Go on flex wit it
Do it how you wanna
Slow it up do the Matrix

Get all in their face wit it
This dance for the killers, the dealers, the cut throats
You already know
The chillen, the grown folk


Lean wit it, rock wit it!

Got you yelling and I thought you pull out a gun hit four
But you's a scary dude believed by very few

My partners busting shots, I tell em ""stop, it make the block hot""
Yo label got got cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot and it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Although we not y'all, if it may pop off
I'll answer the question ""Will I get your block knocked off?""
This what it is bro, look, I will kill bro

All my soldiers over there in Iraq

What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey


You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away


You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?


You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?

Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'

Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day

Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though




First, I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a ho? Take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas, after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta, show niggas with ammo
We ride Phantom, holler shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the Haze
Gator green Chevy, gator guts, alligator Js



Lean, lean (x8)
Get ya shoulder, shorty
Lean, lean (x8)

I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig


We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused


Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""


We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused


Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)


We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused


Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)


We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)

You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt


Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt


Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich
And I'm a flirt


Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig


Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cuz another man will
Better eat eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz you leave ya wife and I see ya wife
Now be for real, how long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cuz you the business type
That's till I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cuz you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, put my plan in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt


When I, when I, when I
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, damn twenty-eights
Then I be like girl you know just who I am, don't hate
See I done fell in love with a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass Down
I be like como se llamo, lil' mama me llamo Pain
What is your name
I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same
I'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly, yes he's so cool
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt




Oh, it's the remix
Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club
Acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug
We was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by
You turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling my daddy and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means
That means if you love your chick don't bring her to the V.I.P
Cuz I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
Cuz I'mma flirt with her, right
He gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit
She gon' flirt with her
I'm a flirt

Soon as I seen her, shieet, told her I'd pay for it
Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here, she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her, ""This s'posed to be yours"" (ha ha!)
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga n' she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even kno' how to tho'it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, ""I'on't usually do this, I'on't fuck on the first night
Cause after I beat ya baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life!""
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust-it baby, cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whatever I wanna get off, she know how to get me right

Look how dat pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bowlegged and bend the co'ner
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on 'em!
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga, do'nuh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin 'er off, cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda
Babe snatchin, not now, I'm tellin ya, I promise!
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame

She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thang
Ever since I ran up in shawty, she ain't been the same

Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans
Boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them


Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her


Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo') next thing you know

Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock


Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

If you think you finna get her with a goddamn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change
She a fool, been to school, even walked across the stage
And she say, ""I love Webbie from his looks to his ways""
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own, I don't think she'll never look

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in


A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher


Motherfucker, I'm ill


A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it


Motherfucker, I'm ill


See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos

This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring

Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""

You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from…


In New York (ayy, aha) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (aha, aha, aha) (uh, yeah)

New York (yeah), New York (uh) (I made you hot, nigga)


Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's…


In New York (ayy) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
(Welcome to the bright light, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)


Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip , now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien


In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)


One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, ""Yeah"" (come on)
(Come on) Yeah (come on)


In New York (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours

How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?


Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten

Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I


It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I


Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I


It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I


Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I


It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I


Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By concensing dookie eyes
People think they diss my person
By stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, ""Black is Black""
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky

That like to front in their rides

You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want BASS
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out
On your loving, your loving


I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way


I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving


Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way


I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (to the bridge)
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving


Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way


I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me

C'mon, man


And with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight


Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price


I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
'Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme


I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)

Breakdown!


Uh, Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold


I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH, damage UHH, damage UHH, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)
I'm ready (We're ready!!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, HARD!
Knock you out, mama said knock you out


I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush


I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover


Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush


Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time


Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than...
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, baby this is more than a crush

Keep your chicken head, I'm lookin' for a dime (word up)
Get my swerve on, make it hot, word bond
I'm lickin' on your ankle bracelet
We'll be sippin' Moet with strawberries to chase it
I'm nasty, ask me, why I lick my lips
So in the darkness, I can run my tongue over your tits
It's all good sugary, you ain't leavin'
Sit up on my face and help my stash grow even
Whipped cream taste mean from the back
She bounce with LL now shorty's on the map
I put away the gat, took off the hat
Throw ya Mo's in the air if you like it like that
No doubt boo, I keep it real girl
Mad pleasure, blowin' up your whole world
Whatever's clever I got endless cash
Trees from Hawaii, two pulls and pass


I'll be lounging with LL, Cooool J

I ""Turn Off the Lights"" like Teddy (click!)
I'm fiendin', starin' in the darkness, now I'm ready
Uhh, ooh yeah up in ya!
Let it flow while I pump slow
Then I speed it up, heat it up
Make it mo' tasty, so you can swing low and lace me
Use your imagination
You do me, I'll do you, sex education
It's all good, it's cranberry Absolut and peach scnapps
Feelin' tipsy, loungin' on the rooftops
I'm 'bout to spank you on that ass (oooh)

Warm it up sugar, make it hot
Shorties'll swarm, make me wanna bust shots (BO!)
We speak, daily on the regular
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand
Layin' up at night, peepin' out stars
Remember, when we was at the club at the bar?
I told ya, my status, was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on
But my mind has attractin qualities
On the emotions of a young lady (word up)
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)
Shorty this here's about as good as it gets

Crack the bubbly, and let the episode start

I swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth...
So help me God
I just felt like tellin the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that


If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone
Come on


(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)

Was a father

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin down at me standin on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me?
(I'm feelin you)

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possesed by a demon... a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me {bitch}?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

My head was spinnin, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops dissapeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started gettin beatings everday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishin the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul
(Brothers and sisters, hey)
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singin'
Giving whatcha gettin'
Knowing what I knowin'
While the Black band's sweating
And the rhythm rhymes rolling

What counts is that the rhymes
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make ya tough
From the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange

Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?

To make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check
Don't worry be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here

Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't beat a trey
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose your arms, your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a fucked up situation


So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown
So get up get, get get down

Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here with the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect
But late 911 was a joke cause they only joking
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a

I call a cab cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at you while you're crawling on your knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver


So get up get, get get down

Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, deep to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose

Where everybody at divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back for the other man to mack

Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory

No hope, I'm shackled, oh plus, gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope ""god damn""
Wearin' red, white and blue, Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one, so I teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it, I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate that's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand when it's comin' from the left

Lost all contact, got me layin' on my back
Ugh, rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else
90 damn days on a slave ship
Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify our owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'
Haven't got, classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves cause it's all about money ""damn""
When it comes to Armageddon mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year, do you understand
That's why it's hard for the black to love the land


Once again, bass in your face, not an eight track

Like shirts and it hurts with a neck to wreck
Took a poll cause our soul took a toll
From the education of a TV station
But look around, here go the sound of the wrecking ball
Boom and pound when I shut 'em down


Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em shut 'em down

Hit it hard like it supposed, pulling no blows to the nose
Like Uncle L said I'm ripping up shows
Then what it is is only five percent of the biz
I'm adding woes, that's the way it goes
Then you think I rank I never drank, point blank
I own loans, suckers got me running from the bank

I never saw a way to pay a sap to read the law
Then become a victim of a lawyer
Don't know ya, never saw ya

Playing games with my head, what the judge said
Put me in the red, got me thinking 'bout a trigger to the lead
No, no, my educated mind say
Suckers gonna pay anyway, there gonna be a day
Cause the troop they roll in, to posse up whole from the ground
Ready to go, throw another round
Sick of the ride, it's suicide for the other side of town
When I find a way to shut 'em down




Who count the money in the neighborhood
But we spending money to no end, looking for a friend
In a war to the core, ripping up the poor in the stores
Until they get a brother kicking down doors
Then I figure I can get bigger, look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince, defense is pressurized
They don't really want it to be another racial attack
In disguise so give some money back
I like Nike, but wait a minute
The neighborhood supports, so put some money in it
All corporations owe, they gotta give up the dough
To my town or else we gotta shut 'em down

Y'all ready for this
Rastafara Sonna Madda Fa
Drop the lyrics, a'ight


One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
Enunciate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothin' like an idiot, get it
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough


It's funky, it's funky 
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place


If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo, I am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Brothas say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitchin'
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the C
When I'm P-E-R-F-O-R-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I am dope
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style that I am using
Knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hittin' funky enough


Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it


Listen to the kick, drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowin'
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin'
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this, yo Dre you must stop him
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause I sold an SMG to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say, Dre yo you're getting funky enough


Deal with the D-O to the C


I need a break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sittin' down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And I'll kick in the beat to give you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Heaven sent if you’re a hellified dancer
You tried sittin' but it just won't work
Cause the beat is so fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough


And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it


It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy

Yo Dre let's kick it on the one, black, and we don't stop
Making records that people are cold checking and respecting and
It rocks, the sales won't stop, those of the Doctor...

And I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all, pumping it yes y'all
D.O.C. on the set we're kicking fresh y'all
Letting the bass G-O and full with soul so I can wait
Leaving the rest to DJ Dr. Dre

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

When I hear a bass drum, I gotta get dumb, but some
Think it's a fable and label me not able to come
Correct, so I cold jet back to my room
And invent something to compliment the boom
Of a kick, cause I want it all like in Monopoly
The great make not a mistake, make sure it's properly done
Strictly for public satisfaction
So you're in awe when I'm in action
Cause all we do, from me to you, is a song
Strong, bump intention tumping system is born
I deliver, somthing to shiver you peak level
And if you want it deep, yo Dre go get a shovel
And you're bumping, your speakers rattle
This is all over the world, but without a saddle
Light the twice, I hype the mic, make it dumb
And Dre is the engineer, but I'm the drum

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

I want you to turn up the radio, listen to the lyrics
And I let the bass go so you can hear it
Bumping, your speakers are thumping, dig it, yeah you like it
You know the album? Get it
And I'll keep producing and inducing
A rhythm with a style that makes you get loose and
Sweat, cause I'm as good as you've gotten yet
Some said they can handle, you wanna bet?
And I don't understand the misconseption
Think that if you make it, you go in one direction
When you're in flight, yo, you gotta fly high
So you were born, so you die
It's all evolution, here's the rule
Evolve, my meaning, enroll in a new school
Adn learn the tricks that makes the mix dumb
Then be certain to keep suckers hurting when it comes to a drum

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

Yo! And now your eardrums are cold full of the big beat
But you're attatched, like ankles are to feet
So you listen, and as it play you pump it louder
But to your speakers you're sparking some gunpowder
Check it for a second, listen and behold the
Great as I open your mind like a folder
Down with the science, I'm rocking like a musical
So when you're listening, you're seeing me and
Dre cold sweating cause you know we're like striving
For number 1, not number 4 and number 5 and
Nothing can mean more than to make it last a lifetime
In the middle of his mix and my rhyme
Never been in need now that Dre is on the cut
You may think I speak of music but I dream of coming up
Rolling to the homies in the city getting dumb
The sound of the D-O to the C and the drum

Yo, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
Dre, drop it, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

Is that a yes y'all? (Repeat 4x)

Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator


""Cause I'm so smooth...""

The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator


""Cause I'm so smooth...""


Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator


""Cause I'm so smooth...""


Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator


""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

""What'll we get for 10 dollars?""
""Every 'ting you want""
""Everything?""
""Every 'ting..""


Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!


Sitting at home with my dick all hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny


Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!


Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny


Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!


You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowing your mind while you're blowing my brains
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny


Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!


It's true, you were a virgin until you met me
I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're going out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...



I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got



Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

[Kick this tip...
Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I met him in a club hangin' out one night
He said, ""Hello, I'm George...hi, Lyte
How's everything going, huh? How ya doin'?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and uh umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
'Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin'
'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty...""


I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only man I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie
See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""
""Kissed the girls and...""


George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin' in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka
I was looking for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve, he started smokin'
Paid no attention when he started chokin'
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin'
Wish he was here so I could say somethin'
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

Gotta who? Gotta have a what?

Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck


I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin', timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck, so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys, up to no good
C-low on the down low
Cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude, the ruffneck bastard


Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck!


I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts, everything is fitting large
But he don’t gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drink a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants, fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy, a raggamuf'
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff, well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town




I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
He eat, sleep, shit, fuck, eat, sleep, shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners, doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect, now that's a ruffneck!

Smooth like raindrops, a clock goes tick tock
Nothin else to do but relax
So I cruise up the avenue, in my new convertible
I see a cutie, my duty is to flirt a little
Get out the car and shake a few hands
Kick some 'sation then expand
To the next territory, got some people waitin for me
Get to the spot, drop the top, and then we his-tory
Move down to the Apollo, 125th Street
That's where the people of all creeds and colors meet
Push up on a cutie, and let her squeeze me
Easy does it, do it easy

Ca-ca-ca-catch it if you can
Cause if you don't, you might m-m-m-miss it

I flow and blow, to the right tempo
My rhymes are in there, for me it's very simple
I'm the extordinaire, others they can't compare
To the six foot two half inch light skinned brother with curly hair
An Overweight Lovin machine, the Boyz are my team
My presence is felt, hearts melt like heated ice cream

Easy does it, do it easy

Grab the mic no setbacks
Come on strong like a blizzard, the microphone wizard
Rather exquisite
Sound check, one two one two
Many are called but the chosen are few
And I've been selected, others resurrected

All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance


The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump


People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance


The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump


Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out


First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump


The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!


The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Keep on doing the Humpty Dance

When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast


Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well


Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin'
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let 'em have it
You can see they fear through they teeth
Treat 'em like Rolaids and give 'em some relief


I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor, not a poet, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son


Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well


Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your freedom will never resist to my contact K-Oss and the homie G


187 breakin' back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse and I'm gettin' loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin' bodily harm
Makin' moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to diss me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
Your position as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin' a toy, employin'
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin'
What I'm doin', and ruin anyone's hope for my position
Tell em KM.G, they on a mission


They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes

Now I got a murder rap
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin'
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

All hail to those who believe in lying
For they know the spirit of our life
True as a brother make his way in life
Shall he make it uncontrollable towards any other being


First let me explain that I'm a hustler
Now here's an example of what a hustler must do
In this lifetime you got two things
Bad and good, and ain't nothin in between
Now I'ma break down a little slogan
So you can figure out the path that I'm strollin
Some say it's hard, some say it's dirty
Some say it's all sex, money and murder
Now me myself, see, I'm a hustler
And I rather be that than a new jack buster
I'm always known for doin somethin
Cause I'm always in the mix when the shit start jumpin
At a club and at a house
If a sucker disrespect, I get upset
Now I'ma make my plan to get with it
I'ma hit, and seek, and destroy it
Now what could I really be sayin?
That all set aside, that I don't be playin
187's a killer, even iller
And I'm also a thriller
And of course I'm untouchable

It's not what you know, it's what you can prove
(For the so-called law)  --] MC Ren


See, I got to misbehave, just a little taste
Push up, increase, yo, I start the phase
New lyrics, breakin like a running rebel
For the words are defined, cause we're on a higher level
Cause I'm goin out with Jack in my system
Hustlers from the house, you can just list them
Lookin for some heartbeat, ready to rumble
If I spot a soft sucker his world's got to crumble
Pardon me a moment, I be just at it
Brothers claimin what ain't there, they're rhyme bandits
I will arraign my death until I reach my peak
And if the king slip, I've got to impeach
(KM.G, do you have the contacts?)
The homie Ant, K-oss with the dope tracks
On the 12 spin, behind his back
2nd DJ jumpin off is Go Mack
On a mission to keep on dishin all fools
187 got the right, cause we wrote the rules
Lyrical techniques keep fools in a daze
Straight up your panjacks just to hear me faze
(Now what about the brother we took out?
Don't sweat him, cause he didn't have no clout
Cause yo, in attack I broke his back, I show no slack
And I never got caught because
I'm untouchable)

It's not what you know, it's what you can prove
(For the so-called law)  --] MC Ren


Untouchable, on the Cali streets
On the corner where the dope and destruction meets
Where a cool young brother could never be soft
On a top-dollar street where shit jumps off
You're never up on a, tagged as a tinted
You're tryin to get out, but you're already in it
Cause pooh-put suckers don't amaze me
Cause I live my life wild, ruthless and crazy
If I don't hit you, you probably hit me
How could it be, I'm the illustrator KM.G
And see, that's just one thing that never happens
KM.G, 187 - lose when we rappin
See, we slide out some suckers who be nappin
Grab the mic, put in the clip and commence to start cappin
Cause when we flow, we got dignity
And we're givin the world an opportunity
That there's a lesson to be taught when you come to our show
Cause we scratch on our table, and bust the rhyme flow
Plus our lyrics is steaks, and rhythms come clean
Do damage, break backs, if you know what I mean
We stay untouchable

It's not what you know, it's what you can prove
(For the so-called law)  --] MC Ren

A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my head grow?
Will the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my nine anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob


(America's Most Wanted)


Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt, I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette, then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue, but they can't catch me yet
'Cause I'm slick as slippery
They can't get with me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig, so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted


Aiyo, here's what the poster read
""Ice Cube is wanted dead""
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap, wou know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'Cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America


(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)


Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let 'em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be
(What up, G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted


AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, Chill, T-Bone, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee

Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must

And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills

Come my way and get served
Still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin
Never seen with a happy grin
Show the fat frown cause I'm down, take a look around
All you see is big black boots steppin
Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
Label this nigga' tape with the sticker
Diggin' out girls that's ""nicety""
Plus I gotta body count like Ice-T.

Dig it cause I get wicked

Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

And we might just see a sequel
Cause police got equal hate

Through with Daryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?

We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave

Cause now it's on to the fullest

Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day


Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day


Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day


Hey, wait, wait a minute!

Chorus
Treat 'em like they wanna be treated
You should treat 'em right
(Repeat 4x's)
Yeah, oh yeah
What you need to do...
You should treat them right
Oh, yeah

Why girls play with my feelings?
I don't know so that's why I ask
Maybe it's true that I set myself up
But then again it's the question I asked
I want someone for me who is straight
A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate
I've been around searching for the right one
But it seems like a waste of my time
Every time that I meet the right 1
It seems as if she plays with my mind
So it makes me on the defense side
Because my offense is sort of slow
It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you""
Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no
I think I give in. My feelings, they show
I think I'd better not look back
I've been down a little too long
And now it's time that I get on track
So I must...

Chorus

I like to mingle when I do mingle
I love to mingle when I do flirt
I get off hand and tell the stories
About my past & that's when it hurts
But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type
Who wants me for self
A woman who wants me because of Father
Not for the fame or for my wealth
So I can ""Show her how I feel""
Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky
But being picky is just for self
I must protect what I respect
And that is me & not someone else
I've been mistreated up on the downhill
Back in the days I used to be strong
I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk
Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone
But payback is a mother
And now I don't know who to trust
So I just...

Chorus

Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again
Nah, never

(No, no no no no no...)

So listen ladies I'll treat you
How you treat me back in return
I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up
But my feelings are my main concern
So don't think that I'd give in
Cause now I know how to show
My feelings when I get involved
I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No""
I'll treat you like you treat me
I'll be straight loyal & all
So don't take advantage of Father
Because I'll step up but not crawl
So give me what you can give me
Love, attention, a lot of respect
I don't ask for a whole lot
But I'm gone if you wanna step
That's why I like to take it slow
Not rush because I want more
The next time that I fall in love
Hmm, you bets I'll be sure

(I'm gonna treat you...)
Chorus

So ladies... now y'all know how I'm living... & y'all know what I'm about. And that's the end. So if you feel you can commit, come & give it a shot

(Would you do for me)

(Would you do for me)
I'm talking to you and no one else
I just want you to know...
(Would you do for me)
...that I'll do for you


If you do for me
I will do for you


Well, excuse me, let me let you know the time
On, how I feel and what's on my mind
It's you that I want to be in my life
And if it's possible, you will be my wife
I lead you in the right direction, of course
Never play you out, so there's no loss
I'll be your love daddy, just wait and see
That me and you, we were meant to be


If you do for me (I'll do)
I will do for you (For you)

If you do for me (I'll do)
I will do for you (For you...)

I wanna treat ya like a queen
Cook and clean
Get your bubble bath ready so I can rub you with Noxzem'
And watch how gentle I'll be when I rub your back
And after that there's dinner and cognac
A little romance for the quiet storm
And a lotta lovin' for the whole night long
I'm gonna caress ya body and give you a kiss
And, uh, rub you down where you been missed
Nibble and your navel and kiss your thigh
Play with your hair 'cause I'm on a love-high
Well, I don't know, it's the way that I am
Introduce me to your mother and I'll say 'Hello, ma'am'
Well, I don't know, it's the way I was brought up
Respect my female and never get caught up
In another affair and I believe the same
If you try to be slick, then the doors will open


(I'll do) If you do for me
(For you) I will do for you
(I'll do it for you) If you do for me
(I'll do for you...) I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you


Yeah, you know, sweetheart
I told you once
And I don't feel I have to tell you anymore
It's you that I want
And it's you, that I'll do for


Since we both know what we want, let's get it together
And fly like two birds of a feather
'Cause I'mma protect me and look out for my
Feelings and that's why I always try
To be loyal and gentle, lay and let
Observe the female in case I must leave camp
And if I have to break out, you don't deserve
To live a good life and love a black hummingbird
It may be sexy but it is true
If you try to adore me, then I'll adore you
But if you treat me right, then
I'll treat you with opens arms and a rose just to greet you
Love you dearly, respect and care for
You my dear, so how could you ignore
The way I feel is real from the start
So I stopped playing games and mastered the art


If you do for me
I will do for you (I'll do...)
If you do for me
I will do for you (...for you...)
If you do for me
I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you (I'll do for you)
If you do for me (I'll do...)
I will do for you (...for you)
If you do for me (I'll do...)
I will do for you (I'll do for you)

Yo VIP, let's kick it


Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby


Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it


Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla


Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it


Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla


Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say “Damn!”
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it


Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla


Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Ice ice baby, too cold
Ice ice baby, too cold too cold
Ice ice baby, too cold too cold
Ice ice baby, too cold too cold

Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real

Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister


It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know

Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin

Make sure the door is shut, behind you

But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same

Brothers, things done got too far gone (Tell 'em 'bout it)
We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!


Oh, what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
Hmmm, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brainlocked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
'Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar
Fly kit with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin' more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin to myself—oh, you big, big dummy
Just my luck that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (Not the cash)
Oh, yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein' in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like, ""I love you so much""
But wishin' she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one, I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers


'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger


The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""Fly girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what cha sayin'?)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah I gots to get this""
(P, cool—she couldn't be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid boomin' figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten Gs on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (Oh, P, you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty, sip Moet and bug (So did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?"" (What?)
""I'm pregnant"" (Pregnant? Damn)
Yeah, and the child is yours
So to fellas who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
'Cause she's a gold digger


'Cause she's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger


That's why, men in the 90s must watch themselves
'Cause ladies of the 80s got hip and went for self
With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half
That means the house goes,—
—The car,—
—You, and half your cash
What a price to pay, but if you play you pay
'Cause women of the world they got smart today
They flash a smile and profile,—
—A pucker with a strut,—
—Try to move in—
—Knock the boots
And got stuck, with alimony payments
Time to meet Judge Wapner
You try to flip and cut, but she smiles 'cause she gotcha
You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words—
—""I do""
But look now; you lost the house,—
—The car
Eatin' TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
Boy, you picked a winner
But what goes around, comes around
That's why she wheels the Benz
And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger
(Now you know)
Not to mess with a gold digger


'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger
'Cause she's a gold digger


Yeah, EPMD's in effect, DJ Scratch runs flex, boy
Hit Squad in effect in the house
Large!!
Yeah, she get half

Main Source forever, crews got to get more clever
Whatever, just have your shit together
Cause it's '91, which means not a thing
Cause for centuries we'll make crews sing
No matter what record label, we stay stable
Pick up the album, we're never on cable
Crews cross over, but not Main Source
I use Simon's guitar strings to floss
Brand New Heavies play the shit that people
Used to listen to in '70 Chevies
So we don't have to loop up a beat to fuck your crew up
Just bring the band, by the way we got Jan
On the drums, Andrew plucks the bass with his thumbs
And Simon, like I mentioned before, just strums
The guitar strings for all my siblings
Just follow when everyone sings

Brand New Heavies (Brand New Heavies)
And Main Source   (Main Source)       (Repeat 4x)

Ayo, wait a minute
We got the Heavies in the crib putting the funk back in it
And if you know the Main Source, then you know my man K-Cut
And him and Simon is going to show you what's up

(K-Cut scratches)

I can't forget the other man on the scratches
Sir Scrathes, like his hands are two hachets
While Andrew plucks on the bass
I'm gonna let my man Sir Scratch drop taste

(Sir Scratch gets busy)

Ayo, now everybody sing

Brand New Heavies (Brand New Heavies)
And Main Source   (Main Source)       (Repeat 4x)

Just an example of how rappers don't have to sample
To keep the funk beat on the street
Slide to the side when the Source and the Heavies collide
Bonafied Funk for ya hide
To wiggle, making beatheads uncivil
Turntables swivel as the rap crews shrivel
Away, like a fiend with tooth decay
Peace is not the word to play, hey

Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl


Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, ""Nikki, sleep tight,"" then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl
(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl


Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

Yo Jinx, man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls sympin', man!
Who you think fit the category?


It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O. Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played like I was made by Mattel.
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman
 superior to handle any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers, they'll reply “No…”


“You can't play with my Yo-Yo!”
(Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)


My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt
To the fact I hit the 8-ball often
The earrings I wear are called Dolphins
Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and
If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother)
I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady-like!
But I'm a lady, who will pull a stunt though
I K-O suckas, and even hit the blunt
So what you wanna do? You must play hit and run
It through to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter than a hot whore in snow
Tell 'em, Ice Cube!

 (Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
(What's your name baby?)


That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but no, I'm not a Duncan
As I rap, Chilly Chill bring in the funk and
I'll steal yo man, that's if he is a hunk and
He'll call me Baby Yo, or even Pumpkin
I may be Buttercup, or even Miss Yo
We had dinner, and now we drinking Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's getting cozy
You're home alone, so now you getting nosy
You're kind of young
So of course you had to call my place
Hang up in my face
It's a sad case of who your man's giving the dollars
What? Yep, I put lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler
But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?!
But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

 (Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo
Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha!
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo!
Yeah, tell em whats up


Yo, I hope you realize one day
That you're ""weak"" as Monday through Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio
And next to me?
Ha! You're not fly, yo?!
You lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?!
Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not living like that verse
Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on destruction
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

 (Ice Cube)
They know what time it is
Fools, yeah!
You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo
I'm out. I thought you knew!

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s!
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo


I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on
But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, ""More, more!""
I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior
Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we dare to take the stand
And diss back all the men
Who know no more but  and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet
If we wanna live with justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)

What are you crazy, you know who I am
(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't wanna hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement, lo and behold
The Ice Man cometh, Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
Imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

It's war time, soft MC's hear a beat and it's bore time
Yo, no pretendin, I'm independent
Cause I kill cops yo nigga Warner got dropped

We laugh at the sticka, ha ha ha sticka (Repeat 3X)
So here's another motherfucker kickin that shit!

Verse Three: MC Lyte

Yeah!  You say sticka, I say 'Who gives a fuck?'
I don't front, I do what I want and I'm runnin amuck
""Don't do this, accentuate the positive""
You want Positive?  I'll show you where that nigga live
Cause if I'm positive, it's cause I choose to be that way
Not cause you told me to, cause this ain't no Simon Say
It's representin that I like it like this
Two shits, three fucks, and one bad motherfuckin bitch

(Ha ha ha sticka.  So here's another motherfucker kickin that shit)

Verse Four: Ice Cube

How the fuck you think you're gonna stop me with a sticka?      (Bitch)
I'm under twenty-one still gettin liquor
Buckin niggas down on Sega
Now I got my nine like Arnold Schwarzeneggar
Terminator X rock and roll, if you're able      (Yep)
Checkin out the Playboy Channel on cable
Wish I had a missile like they showed on CNN Desert Storm
I'm just gettin warm
Kill em and kill em and then watch it drop
And they'll let me, blame it on 2Pac
Say 2 Live Crew, and you jerk out
Show the same amount of ass on the Jane Fonda workout
You wish I was in church, in the right attire
To see Jimmy Swaggart, fuck the whole choir (Wassup)
How the fuck you think you gonna punk me?
When Elvis was a motherfuckin junkie!
A fat ass slob and a tramp
Now we need to put Cypress Hill on a stamp
From my nigga Ice-T, all the way to Chuck D
See, we down and you can't seem to fuck me
With a sticka so now I guess ya figure
You'll have to kill a nigga, and that's when it's on

Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?

Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!


Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill


I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change


Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Vic the music and make senseless ryhmes fit


I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read


So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)

 (repeat 2X)
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel *3X*
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop


Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure


Why score all my points in one period
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel



 Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
 Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
 But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid


Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours


Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and I'mma nut like a SCUD see
Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels

Drums Please!


Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind


Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime


Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind


School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime


Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind


It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

 repeated till it fade out
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Beef

Here we go
( chubb rock )
I arrive from the steps of sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still dig van, ya dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that fugee-la voodoo
Will do you like italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like bobbito, the airport, right through heathrow
Release murder niggas like ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's brother jay?
Where's the 'pink cadillacs protected by' whoever?
The red and the black, green, hilfiger nigga
Indians wanna protect the lone howling chief
So kids create beef

( chorus )
Beef
Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

( skoob )
While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the rover, never sober, f**k that
Yo dun, I run with wild crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin
When I rock with chubb you block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood

( krazy drazy )
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The hit squad, chubb rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef

( chorus )
( pmd )
Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, f**kin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like jesse james
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best? but let it rest, because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, pmd, chubb rock

( chubb rock )
Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man common on wax slayin ice cube - anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin'
And of course there's that famous beef between parrish and sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed jane
And now there's nice without smooth - that's insane
And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef

Beef
Beef
Back in the daa-ays
Beef
Beef
Back in this day there's beef
Beef
Back in the day there was beef

That shit got to cease

I got another gang story to tell
Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city
And fool thats bet
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set
Chyeah, Its not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you
Straight off the mutherfuckin block
Can't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked
Chyeah, who gives a fuck about another
Only got love for my fuckin gang brothers
Chyeah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under


Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under


Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
And puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part
I'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart
Fool. At school slappin on the girls asses
Fuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality
Teach me the mutherfuckin gang mentality
Pop pop pop, drops the sucker
If he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker
Chyeah I'm in it to win it and can't quit
Fool, and ready die for this shit
One times can't fade the gang tuff
Putting my foot in your ass to make times rough
I'm the neighborhood terror but I never wondered
That the hood would take me under


Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under
Police is hot, so I'm watching my back...


I guess I'll watch my back cause niggas jeffin'
Times heard this brother pulled a 187
Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine
Fool, if its on then its on, fuck ya G
Because how the odds are looking fool, its either him or me
So I loads up the strap and I step
Cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death
Revenge. Chyeah, that's what its all about
See the sucker, take the mutherfucker out
Stare the fool down with the eye contact
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt
Blast was the sound that one times heard uh
Nigga, twenty-five to life for the murder
Was it worth it I've always wondered
Maybe if the hood didn't take me under

Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth


At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya


I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin'

Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick

I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder
And peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me


Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard

But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch

Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
(And me, the Five Footer)
(I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter)
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?

Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip


Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk

Who's the black sheep, what's the black sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my realm, or wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I guess I can start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (hey)
Can I get a yo? (yo)
You got a 'hat? (huh)
It's for the hoes (oh)
The styling is creative, black sheep of the native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the quest
Dead departed uncles, in pea porridge, may they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam... Now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat


Where's the black sheep, here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying
Yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with this with no delay and
See, in actuality, wonder can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat


You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat


Engine, engine, number nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!


Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it ... sssswiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, doo, dah, dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plate or, cross the fader
Black Sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop ... later


You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at

Quit actin brand new, I know ya fruity

You just don't know you haven't met the Brains yet
At the beginning yes my game is kickin
But at the end, it's the moves I'm stickin
Why don't you come come gimme that booty
So you can spend the whole night wit MC-B
I will caress you and rub you like a poochie
You gotta promise to gimme the oochie coochie
Come on and gimme that pretty body
Any kind of position you have to soothe me
Hand to hand, together you know we
We'll have fun, doin the oochie coochie

Burn Shamrock, burn

All they wanna do is just stab the wound
And after the pantie's, they'll be singin another tune

Now a night wit the Brains is quite simple
I like a girl wit a big smile, and dimple
I take you out cause I'ma lover and a mack daddy
Then I'll rub the kitty-kat under the table, see

And in the back of my mind I know it's time to bone
I got you too my pad, so now you wanna play
But then again you I had to say
Why don't you come gimme that booty
So you can spend the whole night wit MC B
I will caress you and rub you like a butt cheek
You gotta a problem so gimme the oochie coochie

Hand to hand, together you know we

(Chorus: 4x)

Ayo Brains, you talked all that shit, now gimme some names

Those are the girls who like to ride the rodeo

Those are the girls who wanna get a piece of me

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
It's a sunny day and the sky is bright
Chickens in the mist everything is right
No need to make bets cause I'm not a bookie
Today is the day the whole school plays hookie
Why? Cause I called Dinco D and Brown
Cut Monitor Milo brings the sound
Before I do that I play myself like a jerk
Make sure mama jama took her body to work
Okay she is gone so I jet to the phone
Let the whole world know nobody's home
It's Busta Rhymes and I'm feeling irie
Come on over cause I'm having a party
Milo did the right thing and brought the vibe
The sound's too pissed now the party's live
Chicken's in effect, everything is sweet
As I zoned in my rest all I had to say is
That beat, that beat, just keep the same old beat
Check it out y'all, come on, come on
Just keep the same old beat


On the fourth day of school, hookie wasn't here
Today's the first day of a brand new year
There's girls that's rubbing butts around the room
Fellas feeling good cause the gates is boom
Zoom to the doom of a sugarplum tune
Me, Brown and Busta gonna rock the mic soon
With a huh! here we go in June
Powercat with the snap to bend the rules
No-one misses out, this is all street news
You choose, don't lose abuse
Prices move in like crews of brews
Stacked on a four pack sack of freaks
I guess I'll play hookie for a couple of weeks


6 A.M. and I hear my alarm
Rush to the phone and call Vietnam
He sleeps so I leave a message
At the tone, you know time is of essence
Quickly I jump straight into the shower
The baby powder, cause I can't smell sour
Get dressed, put on my Nike Airs
Comb my hairs, go upstairs
Walk outside to the fruit stand
Andre, Kenny, the 40's in hand
Powercat Geronimo is in the distance
The fifths are coming, the fifths are coming
Hit up, lit up the blunt and I'm straight
Quarter to eight and my day looks great
Walk to the school with about 40 feet
That means the squad is 20 deep
I zoned

Zone Coaster (The International...) (Repeat 6x)


Finally by now the whole crew's in the house
Brown just came and he's roaming about
Music just start but yo where is Milo?
Got a chicken in the room and he's trying to hide, yo
Next is my man (Who?) Gary Gennew
Half of the rum and a case of brews
Rumpletilz with the Diggum Smacks
And then through the door came the Cracker Jacks
Posse from Medina cold looking very hard
Next through the door came the yardman squad
Into the crib to find the entry at last
Kallie and the crew with my boy Shabazz
Chickens think they're iller time to settle the score
Dom Powercat threw the lock on the door
Bugging at the jam like I'm cyclone and
Snapped out of a seven hour nap come to find out that I'm zoning
Huh, check it out, yeah


No school? Cool
I'll just fool around off school grounds
Too many kids doing bids in detention
I'm just chilling, what is this they mention?
L.O.N.S. to the set, look he has a gun
'91 is fun, lots of baked buns
Prepare to wind to a reggae cut
Knock knock, who, what
Mom, a bomb, sound the alarm
Leave the dance before she causes some harm
I go out the back door with a hard bone
Look at the clock and then I start to zone


Got to the hive, no one was there
Truant officers began to stare
Called Dinco D but he's not home
Drop another quarter into the phone
Call Busta Rhymes, what's up my man?
(Having a party, understand?)
Where's Dinco D, you know, the D?
(Here's the phone) (What's up C.B.?)
I'm coming (Hurry up, hurry up!)
Milo started throwing on all the cuts
Walking to the crib and I heard ""Hello""
Turned, it was Epitome and Shamello
Told them the scoop and I kept stepping
Almost had to stop then I started sweating
Rob pulls up, he says ""Come on get in""
Place it was packed with stupid skins
Got to Busta's crib and grabbed a 40
Cracker Jacks have it naughty naughty
Grabbed the gold tone microphone
Woke up Saturday, I zoned

Zone Coaster (The International...) (Repeat 16x)

Yo, what's that sound right there, y'all? What's that sound?
You know what I'm sayin', yeah


And it goes like this...
Skip to my Lou (Yes!)
I got a funky hop-scotch game goin' on (Get strong!)
I think you better follow this and come along
Heavens to Murgatroyd, we've come with another new song
(Sing along!) Ha! (Tic!) Tica-tica-toc
(Who's that?) Comin' around the block (Leaders of The New!)
Yes, with the shit that is sure to hit the spot!
Oooh hot, yes! Come in my Dragon's Lair, that's when I turn slayer
You know you better say your prayer!
(Open your eyes!) Rise! Yes, I've come to (Civilize!)
Mr. Parasite, I got your big surprise
Mad effective as you vision my perspective, hot shot
Look at what you got, a super ache infected speed knot
Yo, it seems stunnin' every time I see the fraud comin'
100 miles and runnin', time to cock back the tool and start gunnin'
Let me tell you somethin', you ain't sayin' nothin' with your fussin'
Now you got my cussin', bake you like a muffin full of stuffin'
For the world to see ya
Leaders of The New is in the place to be for '93 (Check it out)
(What's Next!?) We come fresh, no batty bwoy can test!
(What's Next!?) You know we wicked and we full up of finesse!
(What's Next!?) 'Cause when we deh a dance, we have fi impress!
(What's Next!?) To my brother C. Boogie Brown to come down!


Brooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooown!
You know I love they way it's goin' down (Goin' down!)
You know I love they way it's goin' down (Goin' down!)
I'm the one knight supreme (Bein', all seein')
Soul with the role (No, I'm not European)
Operator, operator, put me on hold
Stories untold, watch the dollars unfold
Watch women approach me with the invitations
Previous engagement, speculation
I hate when my girl says, ""Give me some space""
On the telephone, and never to your face
I paid my dues, so lick the balls!
In the summer, in the winter, in the spring and in the fall
I'm rompin' and rippin', the needle ain't skippin'
Gymnasiums and stadiums, the crowd be flippin'
The new to the next, of course the next is
The greatest, the grandest, of course you expect this
In cash, boom bash, slash, grammatical
Continual residual, flow is radical
All that and a bag of Chips Ahoy!
Tell your homeboys to bring the noise
Sunrise to sunset, yes, you will remember
Born on the 19th day of September
Peace to mom dukes, that's C-dot-B-dot
Not for cock-block, stop and don't jock
So take it, faker, snaker, phonograph, no paper
Just a Phillie for the ride, slide, peace! See ya later!


What's Next!? (I know you love the way it's goin' down!)


X the excessive express man, check it!
(Move it along) 'cause I really can't jack it
Your cement mentality will end up in casualties
I got the right one, baby, and no, you can't follow me
Got pieces of a dream I need to put together
I ain't checkin' for nobody who's droppin' bad manners
Whether I'm in or out of state, it doesn't make a difference
Why the constant complainin' about my real appearance?
Sayin', ""Milo, do you love me?"" You're always askin'
What are you lookin' for, action or romancin'?
Now, who the hell you think you're gassin'? (Are ya crazy!?)
Don't treat me like a Care Bear that's always smilin'
I like drinkin' booze and sometimes wildin'
Don't act new, baby (Huh!), or haven't ya heard?
Keep 110 MPH and I'm in Duesenberg
Keep the main-on-tain and at an even rate
One Newport breath taker in the mornin' and you know I'm straight
(What's Next!?) Voodoo hex, 666 years of sorrow
Broken by the strength of the 7
Just do the knowledge and don't ask no questions
(I know you love the way it's goin' dooown!)
I hit up a green light crossin' and I am passin' on the road to riches
(4-by-4!) ridin' over ditches
Next with the missus, hugs and kisses
The switch you missed cause mental friction
Irrational addiction so complex, fleeeex! (Time to have sex!)
Now, ask yourself, What's Next!?

You love the way it's goin' down!
You love the way it's goin' down!


The sun will come out, but don't doubt the D (Tomorrow!)
Let me see, Dinco, you can come out and play now
If you want to, only if you want me to
Or do strange dimensions of the pensions pile
Dispensers of bad fencers sensors while
(Bustin' loose!) takes over, you're mentionin' how
It came to be in '93 with what you see now
In the corners where you go sportin' cones
Only a lonely homely Jones'll make clones
Tone dial phone, girls grown close to testes
Jinglin' chrome press sewn, Leaders aren't lefties or jet skis
Or what you call your animal when your pet pees?
(Woof!) Fuckin' dog, What's Next, G?

I know you love the way, I know you love the way
I know you love the way it's goin' down! (What's Next!?)

I know you love the way, I know you love the way
I know you love the way it's goin' dooooooooooowwwwwwwn!

Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental

(Warm it up, Kris) I'm about to
(Warm it up, Kris) 'Cause that's what I was born to do


So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this
I'm kicking the type of flow that makes you say, ""You're too much, Kris""
So feel the fire of the one they call the Mac Dad
The fire's what I pack and what I pack is real bad
I'd like to grab ahold of your soul and never let go
Do the jump, do the Hump, and say (""Ho!"")
Now that's the state of mind I'm in, huh...
With rhyme after rhyme I win
The Mac (The Mac)
Known for breaking 'em off something
They laying in the back and front keeping your speakers pumping
The miggida-miggida-miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be
So all y'all with the Dr. Seuss riddles
You can get the finger - the middle



Ay, yo Kris, kick it


I caught you on the scope (the scope)
Peepin' out my rhymes that's this dope (it's dope)
And for you there's no hope
My name (is what?) Daddy Mac, baby
Totally Krossed Out catching all the ladies
At the age I be, I should be playing with toys
Instead I put my head into making you make noise
That's how I kick it, that's my everyday life and
I rehearse to keep it sharp as a knife, man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double-D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word
A little brother kicking rhymes like you never ever heard
Daddy of them all, shooting the gift like a gun
Showing suckers how it's done



Yeah, now you all know (what's up?)
And the Macs are all that (yeah)
And we gonna kick one more verse for y'all

Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Somethin' real smooth, hahaha
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...


Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright


The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)
The bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed
No moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says ""I am what I am, that's who I be""
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright


Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright


Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me...
(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)
And nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"" Yesssss!
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Representin BG's and comin' up strong, and...
(We ain't got no love for the side)
We only love those who love us back, right?


Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright


Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know, really d'know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris?
I said ""Ya warm it up Chris?""
That's what I was born to do!


Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin', is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I came out right
Unlike those moles who tried to ""Pass Da Mic""
It's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)
Everything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill
(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright


Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
It no matter if you’re black, it no matter if you’re white
Just come in de house make we all unite
Tell dem Kriss Kross and dem a drop on de mic and make we dance until the morning light
Tell dem Kriss Kross a de people’s choice we haffi dance until de day light
Your girl inna de place and your hold her tight and dance to the people’s choice
Tell dem Kriss Kross dem a tear down de mic, dance hard cause the vibes is right

Who gotcha open, scopin out the track
It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mack
Still slackin back-packin up my turf
Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst


Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's
But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)

Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister


I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome
Isley brothers on the deck on my cellular phone


I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around
And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now

And all the niggas that I'm cool with
Let em all know that my moms is gone
And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home


Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more
I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door
Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody


True that, so homies don't bring your main misses
Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's
And this could be your very last time seein her
One look at me and you better believe that I be d'n her


So come alone or don't come at all (why?)
Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball

Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)


Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan


Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)


Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan


Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes


Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee


Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan


Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear 
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me


I am everyday people (2x)


I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African



The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it. Africans need to be loving each other and unite

Scoping me up, down, giving me a frown

Holdin' me tight so that I can't leave

Look at my gold and see that girl, I'm tempting her
To be the man, 'cause I'm grand

Everytime they see me they smile and grin
And think of a way to diss their boyfriend
Then he'll approach me 'cause he's upset

Take her to the cab and let her please her

I found out she's nothing but a teaser
But I convinced a freak to get busy

Livin' life to love, giving love to my life
To eliminate stress and abolish strife
Allow me to express with the greatest of ease

I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever
All I know is that you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can't impress
'Cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed
And I could see through you, 'cause I'm the Guru
And what you gonna do when I start to step to you?
'Cause when I pay you back, I'll be hurting you
And this ain't no threat so take it personal

Rap is an art, you can't own no loops
It's how you hook 'em up and the rhyme style, troop
So don't even think you could say someone bit
Off of your weak beat, come on, you need to quit
I flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
There ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can't think this quick
So Premier drops beats for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper, then take it personal


Take it personal

Don't be mad 'cause I don't come around the way
Like I used to, I don't have time these days
I'm keeping busy making power moves
And don't try to say I don't remember you
You shouldn't let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by 'cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don't even know
You're like a daytime talk show, and that's low
So you can tell everyone, that I'm jerking you
And if you don't like it, kid, take it personal

Don't sweat the technique

Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass to MC's get weak
For every word they trace it's a scar they keep
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats

But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context

Pieces are took to labs to observe them

My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique


Never sweat the technique


I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
You fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)


You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Beef like blunts, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the '70s and brothers got on grins
'Cause they can step to some sisters and say ""Slap me some skins
""Honeydip,"" and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill




Word up MC Serch, that was fly. We gonna try like this, though, um...


Bust a style while I do it, if you know it, oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what do you know
So many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like Sasquatch (Not!)
And uh, George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me part of history
Kicking 'em in the grill


Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all, kick 'em in the grill




""Chubb Rock, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock""
""Chubb Rock, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock""


The Chubbsta breaks, head nods, he fakes, steady rate H
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelict""
The murder list, Vanilla kicks it to climb on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell the record bumps
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet 'cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gwen to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill




""So get up and get down, Serch'll never stand still""


So here's a true or false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans that a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree just like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
'Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a club called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but took it back 'cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say, ""Yeah I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

See, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking was I really supposed to be on this planet earth
I take a deep breath, and then another follows
Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough being a loner
Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump street
And being short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks cause I was small
And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga would've quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out
Now I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin ho
And now that my pockets are getting bigger
I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowing that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusing me
But as the time went by I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screaming ""Gimme""
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while shit seemed alright
But just like the first ho, homie
When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me
And it's getting out of hand, gee
Cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low
I broke out the Ever-Clear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, gee
I'mma take that on to Mica cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Ever-Clear and high on that buddah
Get to the house all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her
Cause shooting her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? if I make her shoot me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking
I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time I wasn't thinking about no one
Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby
Held him by the door and said I'mma throw his ass out, ho
She went to crying, somebody stop him
I said: you better grab the motherfucking gun or I'mma drop him
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed stop and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick
Damn! Aw shit, I'm hit
(""Aw... my eye, I can't see
Why you shoot me in the eye?
I would've shot you in the body
Why you shot me in the eye?"")
Riding in the ambulance everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying
Bullet in my head, in the bed was lying
Where's Mica? I wanna tell her I love her
With an IV in my arm I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, the shit's a trip, gee
5 different doctors with needles trying to stick me
I hear my family hollering he needs us
During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus
My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York
Here comes the doctors again trying to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake it
I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it
But I'mma make it cause something's steady urging me
5 hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But god told me everything is gonna be alright
And I'm glad that I'm here, gee
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly

Come on and get it if you widdit, troop
Krush Groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious, about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
Chu ri ka pi kyura mulla kara
Nu gu nya nada na na nun Redman
Na bo da challan nom hana do upda ...
... Nah Duke, forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind
(""REE-WIND!!"")


""You blow my mind, baby"" ""I'll toast to that""
""You blow my mind, baby""
Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind
""You blow my mind, baby"" ""I'll toast to that""
""You blow my mind, baby""
Press rewind if I—HA-UHH...


Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Loaded, of course, more Legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can 'Wax on! Wax off!' like Daniel-son
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode!

(LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose (POW!)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk
Pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac
(STRAIGHT OUTTA JERSEY)
You heard me, my brother, I'm laughin' (he he he he he)
TIME 4 SUM ACTION


(B-Real: ""Time for some action...just""
""Time, time for some, time for some action...just"") 


Lights, camera, cock back the hammer
(EXPLOSION!)
Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'mma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle, brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Come on and let me kick
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Just to show you where the HELL I COME FROM
I get dumb with the 1, 1-2
Check my rep from my hip when I have sex
(LIKE THIS)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, OOPS, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump
(REDMAN READY TO ROCK)
I got a Glock
THEN, POW!; your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to this, the Exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off
Just for asking ""Who's the one rapping?""
(POO POW)

Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid

For the brothers that don't be knowin', what's up
Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava....

AAAAH...
Back to the funk track, like Black Sheep
My man, he say ""Who's the Redman? Where's the Redman?""

Slide off my clothes from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin you around Delware before I enter
Turn to seduction from face hips to feet
A wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete

Of the track 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'
The action, is packed in a jam like a closet
Beats bound to get you up, cold flowin' like a faucet
Not mean to make you sit, not mean to make you jump
But yep make the hotties in the party shake your rump
I like the way you comb your hair (uh)
I like the stylish clothes you wear (uh)
It's just the little things you do (uh)
That makes me wanna get with you (uh)

Body is soft, makin' me wanna squish her
More just than a game, a rumper like a sub-woofer
Shake it to the left (shake it), shake it to the right
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night
Come on, pass the poom-poom, send it to poppa
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it, don't stoppa

Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it
I tried to take you serious before, and you blew it
You figured you was slick, dissin me for the next man
But when you heard he had a wife, it ruined your plans
Now you wanna come back and act like it's all that
But I ain't tryin to hear it, cause you sound real wack
You got it over the first time, but that was the last time
I'll never make the same mistake again in a lifetime
You hooker, no way, no how, you're history
So let's keep it real, cause this ain't no mystery
You had it like a queen, livin lovely and lost me
Your props are at all-time low and you crossed me
I used to treat you good, take you shoppin and feed ya
But now I'm doin fine, and girlfriend, I don't need ya
For you to even ask me that, you must be stupid
Nah, baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it

(Can you do it?)
I'm not gonna be able to do it (8x)


I'm on a mission, and I need me a new girl
My last girl fronted fakin moves with Earl
But that was in the past, finsihed, over, and done with
Besides, I know this hottie, and she's on my tip
She told me I could call her when I wanted to check her
And all I had to do to knock her down was respect her
To think about it, gee, that would be cool
To have a girl that's independent, with a job and school
So we took it slow, then we started to grow
Without a worry in the world, goin right with the flow
Until she cracked my head when she asked me to marry her
And move into a crib in some suburbian area
I knew that this was just too good to be true
And what you're askin me to do, girl, I cannot do
You told me, ""No committments"", and you best stick to it
Oh baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it




Now I'm makin money, and it's good to be single
To mingle with the ladies while their earrings jingle
And that's the way it is, cause that's the way that I want it
When I see a pretty mommy lookin good, I'm on it
Checkin out her profile to see if she got style
Cause if she ain't a 10, she ain't worth my while
I'm all about stickin and movin with the quickness
Forget the foreplay, and let's get down to business
(Yeah, is it good? Is it good, baby?) Damn, my jim hat broke!
But still I kept strokin till her boots were smokin
And left her on the bed with her legs wide open
Tryin to kick it to me like she was my girl
But yo, I had to tell her, ain't no way in the world
Maybe it's the way I hit that thing that souped it
But no, I'm not gonna be able to do it

You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas

How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie

Take ’em up, take ’em out, bring ’em out dead
Shine ’em up, shine ’em up, shine a bald head
One gun, two gun, three gun, four
You’re mine, it’s all about crime
Onyx! Onyx!


It’s time to get live, live, live like a wire
I set a whole choir on fire (Uh!)
Well done on the grill, Chyskillz kills
The no frills that try to diss me, they get crispy
(Ha, ha-ha-ha, and we do it like this)
And that, get back I attack tracks
Cause they can burn in hell shit for all that I care (Yeah!)
Beware the bald heads, the dreads dead if they there (Ooh!)
Stick ups assassin,’ tracks a new reaction
(These fuckin’ niggas shoulda made the All-Madden)
Onyx is wreckin’ shit, slip slide step quick
Super on the tenant, the kids crash like a rented
The shit they write is black and white, well mine’s got
Mad color, ain’t that right my blunt brother?
(Word up! Raze it up!
We do it with the crew that don’t give a fuck!)


So throw ya gunz in the air
Throw ya gunz in the air
Buck buck like ya don’t care


Uh oh, heads up! Cause we droppin’ some shit on ya now
Chyskillz, Onyx, Tec-9 for a while
Keep ya eyes open in a fight, I’m a swell ’em
The hardcore style, rowdy and wild hits I’ma sell ’em (Sell ’em!)
To all competition slide back then listen
I’m kickin’ all that shit to the doormat
Claimin’ this domain, cause mad pains
Blood stains, long range (Got gats!)
Crazy clips, I sink ships, cut faces like a pirate
I’ve never caught a slug for the mad shit that I did
(Heard?) You got the word so observe
I shatter and splatter bodies and bones and bust nerves
(Open!) I always leave my barrel smokin’


Throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care
Just throw ya gunz in the air
And buck buck like ya just don’t care

I hate your fuckin’ guts, and I hope that you die (Uh!)
Sticky Fingaz’ name and my life is a lie
Plus I’m havin’ a bad day so stay outta my way
(And what the pistol packin’ people say ya better obey)
Just in the nick of time, I commit the perfect crime
Rip my heart out my chest, put it right into a rhyme (Yeah!)
I don’t feel pain cause it's all in the mind
And what’s mines is mines, and yours is mine
Don’t fuckin’ blink or I’mma rob yo’ ass blind
Onyx, is rippin’ shit, I got the Tec-9
So what the bumba clot, boy, buck-buck, buck-buck

Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin
But what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM

Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan

Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass


She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--


When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by


Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man


She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me


Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn


She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
Passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
""Aaaant"", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O

Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain

Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam

Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka
Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka


Boom shaka laka, yo, here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ooh ahh
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
?Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!
Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like ""drum pan, a drum pan sound over some uuuuh""
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!""
C'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funky
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand
I'm the motherfuckin man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around
Let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funkee


The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka​


Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the fragrance, the funk
Whew and it's smellin' up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough
See, if I was an Indian I'd still be the chief
The only other difference—I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby, to the hibbidy
Hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B, ya see, all that's cool
But hip-hop and rap, yeah, that's where my heart's at
Even back when I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin'
Freestylin on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin' in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit
Make you jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rocka won't front


The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka


 Ay Mr. Funkee
 Whassup?
 Can I get assistance?
 For what?
 For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my nucca
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
 what goes up, must come down
 But not me clown
I cut 'em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin'
So jump in, and watch your ears start hummin'
Through the block, and don't forget to boom shak shak-a-lak


Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin'
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin up the block
Boom-shaka-laka there goes the Chief Rocka

You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe


Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it
Niggas watch your back, shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me
I'm so much flavor you can taste me
I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin' hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggas wanna front, then come with it
If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't perpatrates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Coco, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I vacate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one
We can do this with the hands, or take it to the guns
You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow


You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe


Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
I'm livin in the Bronx on an ave called Trinity
My name rings bells within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin' mono
Together we gettin' dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo, you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked ball, so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own, never sweatin' nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it that away
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninety-three, it's all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G
Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Mike-ski (say what?)
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beat down
See, I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetery
And that's word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop
So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow


You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe


See, I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest
Cause I'm too hot to handle
Knockin' niggas out like Livingstone Bramble
Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton
I won't lose weight 'cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cipher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin' Fat
Niggas gettin' jealous cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti
If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow


You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta let em know, Joe
You gotta flow, Joe, you gotta flow, Joe

Change the cover of the book

It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya
Boy stay real

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music no frontin
You can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not I could kill you man
For being false plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause
I've been here since strictly business
The era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC
Whodini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff LL
When he was rockin bells
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
The motherfucker. And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind
So stay real

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of me hardcore style type a human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know cause MTV shows it
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees and wanna be's
That's worst than the AIDS disease
So wake up Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead and get to the point
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom

He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yeah


I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams


Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

I've got a good man

Here we go here we go as the tune starts to bloom
With a phat phat phat chorus
1-2-3 if this is O.G
The freaks would ya move ya booties
The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e


Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus




My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it




My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah


It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go


All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day


Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is


All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day


Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um


It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one


All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day


Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs


All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides

When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no


Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch


Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors


Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dicks now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this, East Point and we gone


Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors


Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone


Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213


So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""


Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix


I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother, said ""Damn, what's next?""


They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down


They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate


Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate




I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb


Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ‘cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G


Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said ""My car's broke down
And you seem real nice, would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel




I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level


The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble


Chords, strings, we brings melody
G-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm


If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate

Will it enable to shoot C-Note ""Yo's"" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high

I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dog, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread

I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that
]From falling, tryin' to walk from crawl
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy
And shit stank, so if you plot a lick and hit a bank
And get away, or get gaffled, the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga


I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all


I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
]From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got clout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leach talkin' about
Slow down player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Will it enable to shoot C-Note ""Yo's"" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
A nigga fly and fly, with the desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall cuz Mack 10 want it all
What


I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all


Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hot like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip and perculate
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dog, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dog, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread
I want it all


I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's

Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!


Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear


Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear


Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear


Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…


Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?


Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?


Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated


Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)

You're all, I need
To get by, ahhhhh
You're all, I need
To get by, ahhhhh
(Background sample: Notorious B.I.G.)

Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

(Chorus) 2X's
Mary J. Blige
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight


Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise


Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know


Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?


Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise




Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!


Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives

When the scene unfolds, young girls 13 years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin' they got rank
See SEGA ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas, trained assassins
Do search and seize, ain't knocking or asking
They're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipelines
Infernos outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future look it up, where they say it in the Constitution?
That in the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Got to deal with W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines


Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)


Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with a serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me, 'cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin to do?
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the new world order, time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or keep our ass in


Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)


Listen up, lil nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew every day
On the average 'bout four or five, I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
Now I realize the cost after I lost my best friend Bean
I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin?
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't 16 years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox, I want outta this hole
I'm in a cell under attack, loc up folks
They in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reach the planet without the black man


So what's your aim? Try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home
And not wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking, no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask on the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow


Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?

It's really real, when I feel the way that I do right now
I see all my brothers underground
Pushing up daisies, man, it amazes me
That you can't see where you gonna be
A statistic, everybody's gon' call ballistic
If you had a good day, damn, I must have missed it
Cause you mad at the Universe
Going to hell with everybody else cause you want your own first
I got the urge to let you in on a little secret
Cause you keep dying if I keep it
All the keeling that you're feeling is from within
For the copper check the color of your skin
Why lie? I couldn't try even if I had to
Born with the bullet-proof vest when I had you
A black woman trying to get through to the few
So you can leave the next crew

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?

I rather do wrong making that loopy and that hustler
Instead of hot-dogs I'm eating porks up in their smother
And got a gang of loot up in the safe up in my covers
On top of all that I push big fat Lex
And got my hoes that in golf course just in case I feel like flexing
So I must ask, for real though, who are you
See, I'm a big man

(Drecia Vega):
Yeah, you know you'se a big man, check it
I went for twelve years to school and never could read
A knowledge of my hood is something they can never teach me
I never started to step but I kept up with the Joneses
Having rollers... my little pinky ring
I did a lot of kinky thing the girls knew it, flock into it
I'm around my old way, yeah, they still wants to do it
Its not about the clothes that you got on your back
But the money in your pocket and if you're down like that
Come on

Wella, Mr. Black Man tell me where you're heading
The last few years I watched while you were sheading
Pounds and pounds on growth for the population
Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation
A shooting here, a stabbing there nowhere to stop
Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock
I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong
And try to press on
It's not a white man's finger on the trigger
Car-jacks, drive-by's, callin' each other ""nigga""
I'm not here to scold but rather shape n' mold
That young black mind that won't live to grow old
Cause you're fronting smoking on the blunt and
Down with your friends cause you think you're making ends
But you're not - and that's the truth of the matter
Your brother gettin' skinny, cause you want your pockets fatter

Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""


God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo


Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Still we lacin'


Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby


Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on


Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely


And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody when I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody when I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody


Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
And I asked the good Lord why
He sighed, he told me we live to die


What's up with that murder, y'all?
See, my little cousin was hung
Somebody really wrong, anybody wanna test us, dawg?
And Ms. Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know while we sinnin'
He intendin' on endin' it when it ends
He comin' again and again and again
Now tell me, what ya gonna do?


Can somebody anybody tell me why, hey
Can somebody anybody tell me why
We die, we die?
I don't wanna die
(Oh so wrong, oh wrong, oh so wrong, oh wrong)


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads

See you at the crossroads

The world is mine nigga get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga rewind my part fool and....(Bow Down)


(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you


I take ten steps and I draw (Blaow!)
Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is illmental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Philly's
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen I chased the green, the crack scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces
So recognize these real G's, chase the cheese
The Westside Connect keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing is like the California style
But in the meanwhile in my town you got to bow


(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you


Well it's that, Chuck wearing, still sporting a beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me
As I slide my Locs on let my khakis hang
Westside Connect gang, Connect gang, bing bing bang (West side)
Run away run away or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang related simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game
Flashy niggas get stuck up, beat the fuck up
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this
Zero zero apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist I'm real with this
Talk the talk walk the walk
Diss me on wax, I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound so bitch shut up
And nigga all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff


(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

(Group)
(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you


Yea. Ha. Let me tell you something
Gangsta's make the world go round
So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down
Westside Connection. The world belongs to us

(Group)
(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you

It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

Three miles per hour

Introduce myself

Then I loose myself, juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and um
Self-centered niggas'll take two pulls cause they thinking about self and um

Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A

Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be full of that

Fresh jewels, Girbaud, flexing one five oh
Chop up that paper, ho, chop up that paper, ho
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp, doe
Get involved in the backseat

Well, a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the open lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
Have them looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a ho to let my fellas run a train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick
Thinking me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word no was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the feds or spitting game, but it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'mma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp-type shit that Belo and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a ho wanna holler, then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same ho to wanna freak your friends

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something


My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out


Street dreams are made of these

Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier




Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true




Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)


I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

 until fade


This one right here goes out to all my sisters

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me


He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you

Every single thing right like I traveled through time
I come to your city and town
But you could not travel through mine
All I care about mom and how to get it all, all the time
And fuck with me when the card decline
Not when you call to call decline
Tell that bitch don't fall in love, fall in line
Twenty five to life ya I'm going in for real
See I'm in the field like center field
Everybody want to be the realest
Boy it ain't no nigga real as Emmett Till
Nights I would pray for real
I said my grace before I hit a mil
Ain't nobody in my business

Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

Watch your step you might fall

Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all

Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly

Now dad this is a very sensitive subject


Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)


From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you


Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I


Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back


Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I


It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you



Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet
You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
Yep!

Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind

Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain't got no love
For nobody else but you

Cuz you's my boo
I prove to you
My love be true
So do you know where you goin' to
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end

My heart keep tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king
Cuz you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I'm loyal, escape with me

Come over to my place
I'll teach you a few things in love makin'
Now I can't wait, I won't wait
So take me by my arms and rock me baby
Cuz I'mma always and forever be yo lady

Repeat 1

After our first night
You discovered who's the bombest mommy
L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We're sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe

They'll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don't have to worry 'bout me
On the creep
And I don't want you ever to try to
Play me cheap

Cuz I don't sleep around
Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around
Then I'm gon' have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it
I'm puttin' all my sista's up on game
So whyn't cha' peep it

Kiss his feet for freedom, tell em' thank you Lord

Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album and get back the cats that's weak

Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wylin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'

Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English

You scared to blow one, get robbed wit' your own gun

And if I don't kiss you I'mma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks an' bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out
Then I'm gon' stretch you
Husslin' is dead but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And ya'll said my money's spent but it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
For my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street and yall ain't got nothin' for me

Mom's at home prayin' that you comin' home
But you not, cause you sittin' up in the trunk
Startin' to rot
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now Baby
It's goin' down baby
Get the four pound baby
And let off up in a nigga
Especially if he think he bigger
Than my muthafuckin' trigger
Did I, can I get my
Is it on, DMX representin for one time
For the song


It's the key to life
Money, power, and respect, whatchu' need in life
Money, power, and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power, and respect, help you sleep at night
You'll see the light, it's the key to life
Money, power, and respect, whatchu' need in life
Money, power, and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power, and respect, money, power, and respect

I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)(8X)


I live my life as a thug but girl you know I need ya
Each and ever women that I meet damn they don't wanna be ya
It ain't no limit to what we could do
Holla if ya hear me girl you know I'm comin' through
I'm out here on the grind livin' my life fast
And if you really love me lay some blankets on the grass
I know the way I live make you wanna cry
But you know I gotta hustle that's the way I survive
It ain't no changin' me but me and you could make it
Let's fix a plate of ghetto love with grits eggs and bacon
Let me wipe away your ghetto tears misery and pain
All you need is a passport I got the hookup and a private plane


Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you


For a while tears are all that we shared our love was fading so fast
Was right now is wrong gaining fast baby
In the night I sat alone wanting you crying out for you
Wondering who's loving you baby
Something happened along the way the love that we shared has gone away
We tried and tried for a better day for that day girl I pray


Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
Holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)(3X)
I love you Ohhhhhhh holla if you hear me
Don't wanna go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye then take my heart with you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
Can we go on livin' without you
I got the hook up holla if you hear me (Ughhhhhh)
And if we say bye bye bye bye


Don't wanna be lonely I Don't wanna be lonely (holla if you hear me)
Ya heard me I ain't tryin' to be lonely (Don't wanna be lonely)

Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)


Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing


The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

The CD single


Never has ev-ery member in one crew been so diverse
Tryin to outdo the last verse that I birthed, that is my curse
Your knight in rhyming armor sentimentally slay all grand dragons
Grab the sharpest No. 2 then I'm stabbin
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin


I fly through the night, yeah
Mixing 'Card with some Sprite, lyrics we put inside ya
Listen to these A-T-L riders (hooo hooooo!)
Keep your head straight, the street's full of snakes
Slithering, making.. deals, delivering
UHH uh uh, that weed got you shivering
Paranoia, fifteen hundred go to the lawyer
After paying his rent, dollars and cents
They're stealing pit-BULLS, put up a fence
We movin on, tell the crew it's on


'Kay, here it go
They call me Sugar Baby Shawty Lo
I'm one fourth of the migh-ty
G-double-O, D-and-the-I-and-the-E, the M-and-the-O


Yo, this ain't no chain to your brain
Pistol and they gon' bang, plus drain ya
Like some Folgers ? ya now
Get in touch with your clothes


Tellin ya home
Anybody disrespect my zone
We gon' get it on til we get it gone
And y'all might get it right
But you gettin in wrong
Or you gonna get shot and blown


Out here the volume workin ?
Stankin cops get your skull split
And gettin with it figuratively
It's just that I showed them
Now they tried roll out
Hopin we'd be on, back in the weight room son
Think of a spot, we'd keep all day
Choppin for the live spots
The thug take your head off your shoulders
Like we take the lid off a jar!


Yeah, look here, been here
Dis here's, diss year's
Gipp one of the firest
To lay it down round here
Gold and the platinum all over the walls
If you ever check the hook it have big balls
Laid it down hard more than one {fuckin} time
Go ahead and get it gone, now I'm out my mind
Went from hubcaps and 30's to the honey spokes
People still talkin bout the last rhyme I wrote
Eighty-seven was the year that I first stepped in
I'm hollerin at Big D, doin time in the pen, I say


One of the dope boys done crept in
Steppin all over your best friends
No weapons just lyrical lessons
And smoked out sessions
The Young and the Restless
Some of the best in the Dirty South
And Midwestern, hemisphere
They wanna be this here, the playa the B-O-I
Gonna run these verses and make you see this here
{Niggas} tried to jock it
I put my plug off in they girl's socket
Know, the D to the F is gon' forever rock it
Lock it, down (yeah, yeah)


The T stands for T-Mo, who's known as a teacher
SouthWest young brother, bringin the pain through your speaker!
It's like a disease to fiend for the cheese you need
Come up and ease the feelin, exhibit and chillin
While dealin with the devil himself, increase my wealth be
More than ten times the average minimum wage
College brethren these days done changed the recipe
Steady taxin creatively maximize with proper investments
Can't be hesitant with them dead presidents
Or you lose, or you could lose your ? but no tools


For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream D-F
For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream D-F


I know a whole lot of brothers in the rap game
But most of them are in it for the shiny thangs
They wanna snatch all ten, maybe stack about fo'
They wanna live in the house but don't want no grass to grow
See what you need to do is learn the tricks of the trade
Go to work, put it down, and den get paid
It's only two of us gon' get caught for makin the sale
I'm one and if you the other bruh, I can't tell
Can't nobody think they come in, and get in the zone
Tryin to kill fo' birds with about fifteen stones

Ahhhhh, lemme get it started, respect that I can finish
You talk about goin to war, if you knowin you can't win
We'll make our money make cash, with no gimmicks
I ride the tank and my back reads No Limit
Mistah rowdy rowdy, write a book about it
Every rhyme, all the time you make a hook about it
Money I count it, but it ain't enough
Heard I had chicks around me, chicks I can't touch
Since I have niggas around me that ain't goin bust
If you ever see like that you know them niggas ain't with us
It ain't my fault if my name spell cash
It ain't my fault if your girl got my name tatooed on her ass
It ain't my fault if your concert can't sell out half the show
It ain't my fault if you do twice as much as me and I get half the dough
Yall saw me style, change my flow

A Pigeon is a girl who be walkin' by
My rimmed up blue, brand new sparklin' five
Her feet hurt so you know she want a ride
But she frontin' like she can't say hi
What?

1 - (Uh oh) Ya'll chicks ain't gettin' nada
(Uh oh) Your pussy ain't worth the Ramada
(Uh oh) Anyway your friend looks hotter
(Uh oh) Game is somethin' we got alot a

2 - (Uh oh) Cause I don't want no Pigeons
Them be them girls who gets no dubs from me
Playin' the bar dumb broke wit her best friend's coat
Tryin' to holler at me

I don't want no Pigeons
Them be them girls who gets no dubs from me
Playin' the bar dumb broke wit her best friend's coat
Tryin' to holler at me


In front of the club I see this girl like, ""Yo love""
Thought she said thug but she called me a scrub
Scrub? What? She musta talk me a joke
Broke Pigeonhead freak, you lucky I spoke
This ain't my Benz there, it's my man's, yeah
But this ain't my car like that ain't your hair
(Uh-Oh) Pigeon, take them fake jewels off
(Uh-oh) Pigeon, take your friend's shoes off
(Uh-Oh) Pigeon, the hell with that crazy shit
Ya'll make me sick, go home and fuckin' babysit
My big dogs gon' love this
King Kirk bitch, get a brush, and scrub this (right)


Yo, chill cousin, these birds is ill cousin
Cause they call me scrub like we can't even bill cousin
Trick Ronald's, you ain't worth the McDonalds
Throw you on the street team, make you shit vinyls
Hey yo Flex, shorty tried to flash me wrong
How she gonna wear sandals wit nasty corns?

I wonder how you get hearts
In dirty Victoria draws with the skidmarks
Uh, ya flat ass gets enough laughs
Take it to the salon, pluck ya mustache
So next time you shotgun, and that ho bitchin'
Hittin' you a scrub, call that bitch a Pigeon


Hey yo, I got two nuts bitch, choose a ball
You only walk Pigeon-toed cause ya shoes are small
You don't shop, you just cruise the mall
No dough, with Lee Press-Ons
Frontin' with ya girlsfriend dress on
You birds wanna take over?
Get some cash and a Jenny Jones makeover
Broke Bitches, I hate Pigeons
Dirty braid Pigeons, medicaid Pigeons, Section Eight Pigeons
Got me fed, burned I tell these birds Shutup
And how my left ear be double her whole getup
Go ahead with your lame ass, blow at night
Throw a ripped dolla at her, tell her, ""Put that on your train pass""


If you got more than one baby father
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
If you strip all week to go clubbin'
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
Buy a dress to front and take it back to the store
Oh yes girl, we's talkin to you
Wanna smoke wit me, wit no money
Oh no, I don't want no


No Pigeons, No Pigeons


Greet your highness, Queen's finest
Gleam shin as three clip street fighters
Deep dish Jeep riders
Outlandish in they expanded rover
Passenger in my own whip, yeah that's my chauffer
I rap for ya, that's my culture
When I holla holla like Ja Rule
You in a trance from the god's jewels
Glance at my car, drool
Grand like the Concourse
Wonderin' damn, how much the car cost?
Ya just another fan, applause, encores
And when I fly through world tours on Concords
Don't need no chicken drippin, save that for Lipton
No scrubs here, strictly Mo' Thugs, dear
Check the listings, no Pigeons
Flat broke chicks, out to get rich off the next bro's shit
Instead of TLC, you give us brotha's B.I.G. trouble
We're just Sporty Thievz, huddle game with the illest rebuttal

Yeah.. yeah..
From the crap tables down in A.C
Back on the block, Jay-Z motherfucker from the, the, the Roc
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same
Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs
B. my niggas was strugglin', to the 'burbs they came
And then we got to hustlin', murderin' thangs
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain
Now I'm Titanic, Iceberg's the name
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game
The best way to describe me in a word, insane
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came
I'm bakin' soda, water, fire, merged with 'caine
Ladies don't know me said, ""I heard he's vain.""
Well, guess what, mami? I heard the same
You heard the name

Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggas scared of that
Got a new motto this year, ""Don't Fuck With My Ones""
Knock on your door, three in the mornin'
""It's just us and the guns!""
See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns
I got the, mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
Fo'-five rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets won't let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
Muh'fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain y'all
Raw the one, like five divided by four
Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all
Reciprocated and multiplied by more
You likely to see Jigga in a widebody or
Drop-top Bentley Azure, holla at me y'all, uhh

I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
'Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
All black in the club, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
'Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn they glad
Let me sit up in they whip til I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon
Uh-huh uhh uhh

You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all night stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby off the chain in this bitch
Have your wide ass open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this shit, suckin and fuckin this dick
Wanna go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick

Long as you satisfied, baby fuck them other hoes
Just keep my pussy horny so you can put it on me
Girl you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do when I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
