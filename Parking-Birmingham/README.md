Parking-Birmingham is a project based on the parking birmingham UCI dataset. The goal is to use clustering to extrapolate categories and then use the cluster labels for downstream classification. 

The pipeline for this project is shown in Pipeline.pdf.

The code and reasons why I chose each algorithm are listed in Parking_Birmingham.ipynb. 

The df.pickle file is the dataset with extracted features and assigned clusters. This was created to load in the necessary data easily for classification.
